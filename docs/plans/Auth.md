Based on the code analysis, here's a comprehensive overview of how authentication and session management works in this application:
# Session Architecture
The application implements a robust JWT-based authentication system with these key components:
## Session Manager (src/lib/session/manager.ts)
. Core implementation handling JWT creation, verification, and management
. Includes functions for creating, retrieving, refreshing, and destroying sessions
. Stores session metadata in the database for tracking login history
. Uses secure HTTP-only cookies for session storage
## Server Actions (src/lib/session/actions.ts)
. Server-side functions marked with 'use server' that expose session manager functionality
. Includes wrappers for creating sessions, getting current session, checking status, and logging out
## Client-Side Hook (src/hooks/useAuth.ts)
. React hook for client components to interact with authentication system
. Provides authentication state including loading status and user information
. Includes functions for checking auth status, logging out, and protecting routes
## Middleware (src/middleware.ts)
. Route protection at the network level
. Redirects unauthenticated users from protected routes to login
. Redirects authenticated users from auth routes (login/register) to dashboard
## API Routes
. /api/auth/check: Verifies authentication status for client components
. /api/auth/logout: Provides logout functionality for client components
. /api/sessions: Retrieves session history for the dashboard

# Authentication Flow
## 1. Login Process
. User submits credentials via LoginForm
. Server validates credentials and calls createSession() with user information
. JWT token created and stored in HTTP-only cookie
. Session metadata recorded in database
## 2. Session Verification
. Middleware checks for session cookie on protected routes
. Server components call getSession() to verify current user
. Client components use useAuth() hook to access authentication state
## 3. Session Management
. Automatic session refresh when approaching expiration
. Sessions tracked in database for login history and security
. Session status checks for validity and remaining time
## 4. Logout Process
. Server action destroySession() clears session cookie
. Client-side logout through API endpoint and useAuth().logout()

# Security Features
## Route Protection
Middleware redirects unauthenticated users from protected routes
useAuth().requireAuth() protects client-side operations
Server components verify session before displaying sensitive data
## JWT Security
Signed tokens using HS256 algorithm
Stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks
Environment variable JWT_SECRET for token encryption
## Session Monitoring
Tracks IP address and user agent for each session
Dashboard displays login history for security awareness
API rate limiting for sensitive operations (implied)

# Dashboard Implementation
The dashboard (/dashboard) is a protected route that:
. Verifies authentication using getSession()
. Displays user information from the session
. Shows login history and session statistics
. Includes a session chart component that visualizes login patterns

# Best Practices

## Type Safety
Strong typing with TypeScript interfaces for all session operations
Well-defined error types and handling
## Error Handling
Graceful degradation when sessions are invalid
Logging of all session-related errors
Clear error messages for debugging
## Separation of Concerns
Core session logic separate from server actions
Client and server authentication clearly separated
Well-documented API with README explaining usage
This authentication system provides comprehensive security while maintaining good user experience through features like automatic session refresh and clear session status information.
